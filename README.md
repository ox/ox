### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer who loves and believes deeply in the web. I enjoy reviving old software and services and giving them a second life.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on writing an [OSCAR/AIM server](https://github.com/ox/aim-oscar-server) to facilitate chatting between old AIM clients. I have a hosted service called [runningman.network](https://runningman.network/).
